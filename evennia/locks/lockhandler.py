"""
A *lock* defines access to a particular subsystem or property of
Evennia. For example, the "owner" property can be impmemented as a
lock. Or the disability to lift an object or to ban users.


A lock consists of three parts:

 - access_type - this defines what kind of access this lock regulates. This
   just a string.
 - function call - this is one or many calls to functions that will determine
   if the lock is passed or not.
 - lock function(s). These are regular python functions with a special
   set of allowed arguments. They should always return a boolean depending
   on if they allow access or not.

A lock function is defined by existing in one of the modules
listed by settings.LOCK_FUNC_MODULES. It should also always
take four arguments looking like this:

   funcname(accessing_obj, accessed_obj, *args, **kwargs):
        [...]

The accessing object is the object wanting to gain access.
The accessed object is the object this lock resides on
args and kwargs will hold optional arguments and/or keyword arguments
to the function as a list and a dictionary respectively.

Example:

   perm(accessing_obj, accessed_obj, *args, **kwargs):
       "Checking if the object has a particular, desired permission"
       if args:
           desired_perm = args[0]
           return desired_perm in accessing_obj.permissions.all()
       return False

Lock functions should most often be pretty general and ideally possible to
re-use and combine in various ways to build clever locks.



Lock definition ("Lock string")

A lock definition is a string with a special syntax. It is added to
each object's lockhandler, making that lock available from then on.

The lock definition looks like this:

 'access_type:[NOT] func1(args)[ AND|OR][NOT] func2() ...'

That is, the access_type, a colon followed by calls to lock functions
combined with AND or OR. NOT negates the result of the following call.

Example:

 We want to limit who may edit a particular object (let's call this access_type
for 'edit', it depends on what the command is looking for). We want this to
only work for those with the Permission 'Builders'. So we use our lock
function above and define it like this:

  'edit:perm(Builders)'

Here, the lock-function perm() will be called with the string
'Builders' (accessing_obj and accessed_obj are added automatically,
you only need to add the args/kwargs, if any).

If we wanted to make sure the accessing object was BOTH a Builders and a
GoodGuy, we could use AND:

  'edit:perm(Builders) AND perm(GoodGuy)'

To allow EITHER Builders and GoodGuys, we replace AND with OR. perm() is just
one example, the lock function can do anything and compare any properties of
the calling object to decide if the lock is passed or not.

  'lift:attrib(very_strong) AND NOT attrib(bad_back)'

To make these work, add the string to the lockhandler of the object you want
to apply the lock to:

  obj.lockhandler.add('edit:perm(Builders)')

From then on, a command that wants to check for 'edit' access on this
object would do something like this:

  if not target_obj.lockhandler.has_perm(caller, 'edit'):
      caller.msg("Sorry, you cannot edit that.")

All objects also has a shortcut called 'access' that is recommended to
use instead:

  if not target_obj.access(caller, 'edit'):
      caller.msg("Sorry, you cannot edit that.")


Permissions

Permissions are just text strings stored in a comma-separated list on
typeclassed objects. The default perm() lock function uses them,
taking into account settings.PERMISSION_HIERARCHY. Also, the
restricted @perm command sets them, but otherwise they are identical
to any other identifier you can use.

        Notes:
            A lock is executed in the follwoing way:

            Parsing the lockstring, we (during cache) extract the valid
            lock functions and store their function objects in the right
            order along with their args/kwargs. These are now executed in
            sequence, creating a list of True/False values. This is put
            into the evalstring, which is a string of AND/OR/NOT entries
            separated by placeholders where each function result should
            go. We just put those results in and evaluate the string to
            get a final, combined True/False value for the lockstring.

            The important bit with this solution is that the full
            lockstring is never blindly evaluated, and thus there (should
            be) no way to sneak in malign code in it. Only "safe" lock
            functions (as defined by your settings) are executed.
